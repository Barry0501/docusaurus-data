# Introduction to SQL Select

**In this tutorial, we'll learn about databases, different types of databases and their uses.**

The SQL `SELECT` statement is used to select (retrieve) data from a database table. For example,
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name 
FROM Customers;
```

Here, the SQL command selects the `first_name` and `last_name` of all `Customers`.
